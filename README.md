## Frontend

This mobile application is developed using React Native. The design process incorporates key components such as 
`Text`, `TouchableOpacity`, `TextInput`, `StyleSheet`, `Image`, `ActivityIndicator`, `View`, `SafeAreaView`, `ScrollView`, `FlatList`, and `Alert`.

### State Management

In React components, two types of data govern their behavior: `props` and `state`.
Props are set by the parent component and remain fixed throughout the component's lifespan. 
In contrast, the state is used for data that can change over time.

## Backend

For the backend development of this application, I chose to use Node.js with the Express framework. I use the following packages to increase functionality: 
`jsonwebtoken`, `nodemon`, `express`, `mongoose`, `cryptojs`, and `dotenv`.


1. **Node Mongo (CRUD):** Performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a MongoDB database using Node.js and mongoose.
2. **Obtain Access Token with JWT:** Generating and validating JWTs for user authentication and authorization in your Node.js application.
3. **Node.js RESTful API:** Building RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, handling HTTP requests, implementing CRUD operations, and delivering JSON responses.

```bash
### Backend
1. Open the terminal and run `npm install`
2. Run the command `npm start`

### Frontend
1. Open the terminal and run `npm install`
2. Run the command `npm start`
3. To run the app on iOS, press `i`; to run on Android, press `a`
```
